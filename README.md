## Project when I wanted try working with API but not simle API like much more free API's for begginers.  
Here We have API from MET Office. They have over 5 000 locations with weather forecast. Some locations like my city where I living right now don't have forecast.  

**What have I learned:**  
How to work with API.  
How to work with Arrays.  
  
**What could I improve?:**
In forecast API We have much more informations then in my weatherApp. Maybe I should display more informations for every day or maybe less?   
Better styles in CSS.
